| Criteria    | Redhat IDM | FreeIPA | Keycloak |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Features    | - User Management: allows administrators to manage user accounts and access control<br>- SSO: provides single sign-on capability across multiple applications<br>- Group Management: allows administrators to organize users into groups<br>- Certificate Management: enables organizations to issue and manage digital certificates for secure communication | - User Management: allows administrators to manage user accounts and access control<br>- SSO: provides single sign-on capability across multiple applications<br>- Host Based Access Control: enables administrators to control access based on the host being used<br>- Group Management: allows administrators to organize users into groups | - User Management: allows administrators to manage user accounts and access control<br>- SSO: provides single sign-on capability across multiple applications<br>- Social Login: allows users to log in using their social media credentials<br>- Authorization Services: provides fine-grained authorization based on user attributes |
| Availability | Enterprise product with paid support from Red Hat. | Open source project with community-driven support. | Open source project with community-driven support. |
| Operation   | Requires installation and setup on-premise or in the cloud. | Can be installed on-premise or in the cloud. | Can be installed on-premise or in the cloud. |
| Support     | Paid enterprise-level support available from Red Hat. | Community-based support through mailing lists, forums, and community resources. | Community-based support through mailing lists, forums, and community resources. |
| Integrate   | Integrates well with other Red Hat products such as OpenShift and Ansible. | Integrate well with other open-source software and standards such as LDAP and Kerberos. | Integrates well with other open-source software and standards such as LDAP and Kerberos. |

Based on these criteria, it can be concluded that all three solutions offer similar features such as user management and single sign-on. Red Hat IDM and Keycloak are enterprise-level products with paid support, while FreeIPA is an open-source project with community-driven support. All three solutions can be installed on-premise or in the cloud and integrate well with other open-source software and standards such as LDAP and Kerberos. However, Red Hat IDM has additional features such as certificate management and integrates well with other Red Hat products, making it a good choice for organizations already using Red Hat products.

## Genie

Operation criteria for these three solutions refer to the ease of deployment, management, and ongoing maintenance. 

Red Hat IDM requires installation and setup on-premise or in the cloud, which can be a more complex process than FreeIPA or Keycloak due to its enterprise-level feature set. However, Red Hat IDM benefits from being included in the comprehensive Red Hat product ecosystem, meaning that it is designed to work with other Red Hat products such as OpenShift and Ansible.

FreeIPA is an open-source project with community-driven support and offers greater flexibility and customization options than Red Hat IDM. It can be installed on-premise or in the cloud and has well-documented documentation and community support resources, making it easier to manage for organizations with smaller budgets.

Keycloak is also an open-source project with community-driven support and can be installed on-premise or in the cloud. The tool provides a web-based administration console and REST API for managing users and groups, which can make it easier to deploy and manage than other solutions. Keycloak is suitable for developers who want to build their own identity and access management solutions by integrating with existing applications, microservices, or APIs.

Overall, while each solution has its strengths and weaknesses, organizations should consider their specific needs and IT environments when choosing the most appropriate solution for their operation criteria.

This table provides a quick overview of the operation criteria for Red Hat IDM, FreeIPA, and Keycloak. 

Organizations looking for more enterprise-level solutions may choose Red Hat IDM due to its comprehensive feature set and seamless compatibility with other Red Hat products. However, this option requires a more complex installation and setup process.

FreeIPA is an open-source project with community-driven support that allows for greater flexibility and customization, making it easier to manage for smaller organizations or those with limited resources.

Keycloak is also an open-source project with community-driven support, but it provides a web-based administration console and REST API for managing users and groups, making it easier to deploy and manage than other solutions. It's suitable for developers who want to build their own identity and access management solutions by integrating with existing applications, microservices, or APIs.

This table provides a comprehensive comparison of Red Hat IDM, FreeIPA, and Keycloak across 5 criteria: features, availability, operation, support, and integration.

Red Hat IDM is an enterprise-level solution designed for large organizations that require centralized policy-based authorization management, fine-grained access control policies, and delegated administration capabilities. However, it is a proprietary software solution that comes with a license cost and requires a high level of expertise in setting up, configuring, and maintaining the system.

FreeIPA, on the other hand, is a freely available open-source solution that supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), certificate-based authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC). It is relatively easy to set up, use, and manage, with a user-friendly web interface. However, it may not provide the same level of extensive features as Red Hat IDM.

Keycloak is another open-source solution that's more developer-friendly, supporting multiple protocols such as SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, and user-defined custom authentication flow. It's easy to install, operate, and integrate with other open-source and commercial software solutions. However, it may lack some of the advanced features offered by Red Hat IDM.
