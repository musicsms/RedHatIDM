# Introduction: Current State of Centralized Identity Management

Currently, our organization does not utilize RedHat IdM for centralized identity management. This means that user account information is likely spread out across multiple systems and applications, leading to potential security risks and difficulties in managing user access to resources.

Without a centralized system for managing identities and access control, it can be challenging to keep track of who has access to what information and resources. In addition, having multiple systems with duplicate user information can lead to inconsistencies and errors, making it difficult to maintain accurate records and ensure compliance with regulations.

Adopting a solution like RedHat IdM can help streamline the process of managing identities and access control, simplifying administration and improving overall security. By centralizing identity management, we can better control access to sensitive data and ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

# Introduction: Current State of Linux/Unix Server Authentication

At present, our organization is using local authentication for user access to Linux/Unix servers. This means that each server has its own set of user accounts and passwords, which must be managed individually by system administrators.

While this approach can be effective on a small scale, it becomes less practical as the number of servers and users grows. Local authentication also makes it difficult to enforce consistent security policies across all systems, as each server administrator is responsible for managing their own access controls.

Moving to a centralized authentication solution like RedHat IdM can provide significant benefits in terms of security, management, and scalability. By storing user account information in a central directory, we can reduce the risk of security breaches caused by weak or compromised passwords. It also simplifies the process of adding and removing user accounts, and ensures that all servers are following consistent security policies.

Overall, transitioning from local authentication to a centralized solution can greatly improve the security and efficiency of our Linux/Unix server environment.
